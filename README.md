This solution is intentionally kept simple for the purposes of education and testing scenarios.


## Overview
Hey gang! Professor Feeser here. This repository is used to demo a webhook between GitHub and AAP via a video on my [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser). More broadly, it contains a simple playbook that debugs two simple messages to stdout:
  - "Github webhook from rzfeeser/aapwebhook! Instant real-time updates are GO!"
  - "Following Professor Feeser on Youtube via youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser"

## Overview
Hey gang! Professor Feeser here. This repository is used to demo running a playbook within AAP via a video on my [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser). More broadly, it contains a simple playbook that queries http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json with the Ansible uri module, registers the results, and debugs that too the screen.


## Video Demos
Videos demonstrating use of this playbook in Ansible Automation Platform is available on the author's [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser):

## How It Works
There are some notable features of playbooks/playbook01.yml

1. Queries an Open API `http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json`
2. The JSON returned is a list of humans currently housed on spaceports around the Earth
